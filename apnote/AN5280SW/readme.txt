This is an example using the FlexIO peripheral to drive a graphical LCD.
The example was tested with the TWR-K80F150M board and the TWR-LCD-RGB 
display module.  The example was created using the Kinetis Software
Development Kit (KSDK) v1.3.0, and built with IAR Embedded Workbench for 
ARM v7.50.2.

This compressed file adds an example project to the KSDK_1.3.0 installation.
The file should be extracted to the KSDK root directory, which by 
default is at C:\Freescale\KSDK_1.3.0.  After extracting, the IAR
example workspace is located at C:\Freescale\KSDK_1.3.0\examples
\twrk80f150m\demo_apps\flexio_TWR-LCD-RGB\iar\flexio_TWR-LCD-RGB.eww

Refer to the document "Using Kinetis FlexIO to drive a Graphical LCD" for
more details on the example application and driver.
